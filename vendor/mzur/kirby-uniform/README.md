A versatile [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) plugin to handle web form actions.

- [Log](https://kirby-uniform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actions/log/): Log the form data to a file.
- [Login](https://kirby-uniform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actions/login/): Log in to the Kirby frontend.
- [SessionStore](https://kirby-uniform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actions/session-store): Store the form in the user's session.
- [Upload](https://kirby-uniform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actions/upload): Handle file uploads.
- [Webhook](https://kirby-uniform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actions/webhook/): Send the form data as an HTTP request to a webhook.

## Quick example

Controller:

```php
<?php

use Uniform\Form;

return function ($kirby) {
   $form = new Form([
      'email' => [
         'rules' => ['required', 'email'],
         'message' => 'Email is required',
      ],
      'message' => [],
   ]);

   if ($kirby->request()->is('POST')) {
      $form->emailAction([
         'to' => 'me@example.com',
         'from' => 'info@example.com',
      ]);
   }

   return compact('form');
};
```

Template:

```html+php
<form action="<?php echo $page->url() ?>" method="POST">
   <input name="email" type="email" value="<?php echo $form->old('email'); ?>">
   <textarea name="message"><?php echo $form->old('message'); ?></textarea>
   <?php echo csrf_field(); ?>
   <?php echo honeypot_field(); ?>
   <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<?php if ($form->success()): ?>
   Success!
<?php else: ?>
   <?php snippet('uniform/errors', ['form' => $form]); ?>
<?php endif; ?>
```
