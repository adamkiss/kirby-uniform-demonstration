# Kirby Starter

This is just a basic StarterKit (as of version 3.5.7.1) with a simple form and [mzur/kirby-uniform](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform) installed, to demonstrate how to implement custom guards and custom actions.

---

Important files:

- [`site/controllers/home.php`][controller]  
form implementation
- [`site/templates/home.php`][template]  
form in the template
- [`site/plugins/uniform-guards/index.php`][guards]:  
plugin with the custom guard
- [`site/plugins/uniform-actions/index.php`][actions]:  
plugin with the custom action

That's everything.
